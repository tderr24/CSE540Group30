# PharmaTrace  
### Blockchain-Based Pharmaceutical Supply Chain System  
**Course:** CSE540: Enterprise Blockchain Applications  
**Team:** Group 30 - PharmaTrace  

---

## Project Description

PharmaTrace is a blockchain-based supply chain system designed to combat counterfeit drugs and ensure product integrity in the pharmaceutical industry.  
By leveraging Ethereum smart contracts, IPFS for off-chain storage, and a React.js front-end, PharmaTrace provides a transparent, auditable, and decentralized record of a drug's journey - from manufacturer to pharmacy.


---

### Objectives
- **Enhance Patient Safety:** Prevent counterfeit or unauthorized drugs from entering the supply chain.  
- **Ensure Product Integrity:** Enable verifiable tracking of temperature-sensitive shipments (e.g., vaccines).  
- **Increase Transparency:** Provide stakeholders with appropriate visibility into product provenance.  
- **Build Trust:** Create an immutable, auditable record accessible to regulators and consumers alike.

---

## System Architecture

PharmaTrace uses a hybrid on-chain/off-chain architecture for scalability and cost efficiency.

### Layer 1 - On-Chain (Ethereum / Solidity)
- **Contracts:**  
  - `AccessControl.sol`: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) managing roles - Producer, Supplier, Retailer, Regulator.  
  - `Provenance.sol`: Core lifecycle contract for registering, transferring, and updating product status.
- **Key Functions:**  
  - `registerProduct()` - Register new pharmaceutical products
  - `transferProduct()` - Transfer custody between stakeholders
  - `updateProductStatus()` - Update product status without ownership change
  - `getProductDetails()` - Retrieve product information
  - `getProductHistory()` - Get complete audit trail
  - `regulatorCheckProduct()` - Regulator-only product verification
- **Events:**  
  - `ProductRegistered` - Emitted when product is registered
  - `OwnershipTransferred` - Emitted when custody changes
  - `StatusUpdated` - Emitted when product status changes

### Layer 2 - Off-Chain (IPFS)
- Stores product metadata (certifications, temperature logs, batch data).  
- IPFS content identifiers (CIDs) are hashed and stored on-chain for reference.

### Layer 3 - Front-End (React.js + Ethers.js)
- Web interface with:
  - Stakeholder dashboards (Producer, Supplier, Retailer, Regulator)
  - Public verification portal (search by Product ID)
- Wallet connection via MetaMask.

## Dependencies & Setup Instructions

### **Backend (Smart Contracts)**
- **Language:**: Solidity  
- **Framework:**: Hardhat  
- **Blockchain:**: Ethereum (Sepolia Testnet)

#### Prerequisites:
- Node.js (>= 18)
- npm or yarn
- MetaMask wallet
- Access to [Infura](https://infura.io/) or [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) for RPC connection

## Local Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tderr24/CSE540Group30.git
cd CSE540Group30
```

---

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install all required Node.js dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

---

### 3. Install Hardhat

If Hardhat is not installed globally, install it as a development dependency:

```bash
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

---

### 4. Install OpenZeppelin Contracts

This repository uses OpenZeppelin Contracts for secure, standard implementations of roles and access control:

```bash
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
```

---

## How to Use or Deploy (In Progress)

> These instructions are a draft and will be refined as the project progresses.

---

### Compiling the Contracts

To compile the smart contracts:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

---

### Running Tests

> Unit tests are currently under development.

Run the test suite (once available):

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

---

### Deploying the Contract

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory.  
2. Add your private key and network RPC URL (from [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) or [Infura](https://infura.io/)):

   ```env
   SEPOLIA_RPC_URL="https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/your-api-key"
   PRIVATE_KEY="0xYourPrivateKey"
   ```

3. Run the deployment script on the Sepolia Testnet:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
   ```

---

## Running the Front-End (Future Implementation)

> The React front-end is not yet implemented.

When available, the expected commands will be:

```bash
# cd frontend
# npm start
```

## License

This project is part of the CSE540 Group 30 coursework and is intended for educational use.

### Notes
- Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
- You’ll need testnet ETH (from a Sepolia faucet) to deploy to Sepolia.
